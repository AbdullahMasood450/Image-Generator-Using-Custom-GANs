## Project Overview 
This project implements a Custom GAN using the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on generating realistic images of cats and dogs. Unlike traditional GANs, the discriminator in this model computes a similarity score between a real and a generated image, rather than classifying them as real or fake. The discriminator's goal is to maximize the dissimilarity score, while the generator aims to minimize it by producing images that closely resemble real cats and dogs. This approach leverages a novel similarity-based objective, encouraging the generator to create high-quality and realistic outputs of cats and dogs.
